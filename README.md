## Section 1: App Development Journal

### WEEK 5 - Task 1: Cloud environment

I learned to:
1. Set a cooperative coding environment and manage a project in GitHub
1. Create my logbook/diary setting via README and the important syntax.
Syntax for README edit can be found in this link [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
1. Recognize the most favorable License for my project
1. Deploy a cloud environment for running an app in Heroku
1. Create a DB to feed my app in real time

### WEEK 6 - Task 2: App Structure

I learned to:
1. Upload files or copy files from a repository to my repository
I uploaded and copy the files from [Gabriel's repository](https://github.com/gabrielfuenmar/ene425_emissions_app)
1. Read a directory tree from other developers
1. Create a directory tree for my Emission's app
File Explorer > cmd > tree /a /f > tree.doc
1. Learn what is a fork in Github and what does it do
1. Create a new repository with the emissions app for my own account

### WEEK 7 - Task 3: App design

I learned:
1. How the design aligns with the code machinery in Flask
1. Different ways of editing my falsk app design
1. How to change colors and text in my existing app design
Colors standards for html
* RGB. e.g. rgb(0,0,0) is black
  * A fourth digit stands for opacity rgb(R,G,B,a) a from 0.0 to 1.0
* Hex #000000 is also black
  * Opacity in here goes with 2 additional digits at the end. e.g. 00 is 0% and FF is 100% #000000FF
We can find nice color mixes on this website: [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

### WEEK 8 - Task 4: App deployment
I learned 
1. To sync a database in Heroku
1. To sync my Github repository with a cloud machinery
1. To definie my environmental variables and use it as a first stage security measure
We used a key to point directly to a hidden value. It is not the safest but the easiest (common practice)
1. Heroku basic function


#### Week questions

##### Question 1: What other cloud service can be used to deploy apps from github repositories?



##### Question 2: What option would you consider to make your app safer against attacks (abusive requests that could crash your server, passford theft, ...)?




### WEEK 9 - Task 5: Emissions calculation methodology (responsible diary)
I learned 

1. Mathematical operators in Python
2. Select methodology for my app
3. Criteria for selecting a method that feeds an app

#### Week questions

##### Question 1: What other input values would you use to improve your calculations?

1. Brand, age, size and weight of the mean of transport
2. Number of passengers
3. Car maintenance
4. How it is driven (speed, idling, starting and stopping, acceleration, braking)
5. Energy mix of specific country
6. Connect the app to GPS services
7. Include other greenhouse gasses in the calculators (“CO2 equivalents”)
8. Include CO2 produced indirectly, for example during the manufacturing or disposal of a car

##### Question 2: How would you get them?
1. International Energy Agency and other institutions
1. Scientific papers
1. Cooperation with service providers (for example map services)

### WEEK 10 - Task 6: App URL Redirection

I learned to 
1. get a domain and a web host provider
2. sync your app to your domain URL

## Section 2: Emissions Methodology

### Within this section we are gathering information on emissions calculation method for transport sources:

Here is a list of different methodologies we can use:

1. A basic understanding requires having a classification of transport as urban transport or industrial transport (e.g maritime, air).
A more segregated classification of "vehicles" under EC standards can be found at this [Link 1](https://www.eafo.eu/knowledge-center/european-vehicle-categories), which is connected to the last study of ["Determining the environmental impacts of conventional
and alternatively fuelled vehicles through LCA"](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/transport/vehicles/docs/2020_study_main_report_en.pdf) by Ricardo Energy and Environment for the European Comission. Our observations o this study is that the segregation is practical for our purpouses, but the methodology is on a higher scale than what we are intending to do with the app (local direct emission per km rather than Life Cycle Analysis (LCA)).

2. Global footprint Network

3. Methods for calculating the emissions of transport in the Netherlands: [Link to paper](https://english.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2018/04/Klein-et-al-2018-%20Methods-for-calculating-emissions-transport-Netherlands-2018.pdf)

4. This document presents a general methodology developed for estimating the amount of
carbon emissions (CO2) generated by a passenger in a flight: [Link to paper](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CarbonOffset/Documents/Methodology%20ICAO%20Carbon%20Calculator_v11-2018.pdf)

5. How to calculate CO2 emissions from fuel consumption (typical fuels used in cars and busses): [Link to website](https://ecoscore.be/en/info/ecoscore/co2)

6. CO2 emissions data
[Here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-transport-mode?tab=chart&stackMode=absolute&time=latest&country=Domestic%20flight~Eurostar%20(international%20rail)~Medium%20car%20(diesel)~Medium%20car%20(petrol)~Short-haul%20flight%20(economy)~Long-haul%20flight%20(economy)~Motorcycle%20(medium)~National%20rail~Bus~Small%20electric%20vehicle%20(UK%20electricity)&region=World) Under link we can find CO₂ emissions (in grams per passenger kilometer) by mode of transport, 2018 based on data of UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Different modes of transport can be selected. This can serve as a basis, but can at best be supplemented by data for Norway or more up-to-date data.
